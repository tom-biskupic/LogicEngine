# LogicEngine
LogicEngine is a set of Java tools for experimenting with Algebraic Cryptanalysis.

This project is currently a work in progress. 

The idea is to treat unroll the loops inside cryptographic algorithms and build logic expressions for each bit of the output. Inputs can either be assigned constant values or can be assigned variables. A logical expression tree is built and then reduced.
